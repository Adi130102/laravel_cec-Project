To run the Laravel project using the php artisan serve command, you need to navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt. 

Assuming your project folder is named "laravel_cec-Project" and the Laravel application is within a folder named "laravel_cec", you would execute the following steps:

1) Open your terminal or command prompt.

2) Navigate to the directory where your project is located. If your project is located in the "laravel_cec-Project" folder, and the Laravel application is within a folder named "laravel_cec", you would type the following commands:

3) cd path/to/laravel_cec-Project/laravel_cec

4) Replace path/to/laravel_cec-Project with the actual path to your project directory.

5) Once you're inside the "laravel_cec" folder, you can now run the php artisan serve command to start the Laravel development server:

6) php artisan serve

7) This command will start the development server, and you should see output similar to:
   
8) Laravel development server started: http://127.0.0.1:8000

9) Now, you can access your Laravel application by navigating to the provided URL in your web browser, typically http://127.0.0.1:8000.
